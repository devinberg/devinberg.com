## Abstract
Inquiry-based learning is an educational approach that allows the student to take ownership over the education process by self-identifying a problem and formulating their own solution. The application of this method of teaching was explored in an introductory mechanics course taken by both engineering and engineering technology students. Students were tasked with applying the principles of fundamental engineering analysis to objects found in their normal surroundings over the course of the semester. By asking students to complete assignments where they had to apply engineering analysis to an everyday object, it was intended for the student to look beyond their textbook and relate the course material to their surroundings. Similar work by others has demonstrated success in getting students to make the connection between the classroom and the “real world”. A preliminary study was conducted using this concept for a single assignment involving static equilibrium in the same course. Through this effort it was revealed that, in general, students enjoyed completing the assignment and the ensuing class discussion was more fruitful than with other course topics. As a result, the concept was adopted more fully into the course with multiple assignments throughout the semester. The deliverables for these assignments consisted of either a photograph or a sketch of an object that demonstrated the concepts relevant to the week’s course material accompanied by a brief description of what was depicted in the photograph or sketch. Examples of students’ work will be presented along with discussion of lessons learned and recommendations for the use of this method in the future. Evaluation of student learning outcomes will be conducted through the issuance of pre- and post-assessments using the Concept Assessment Tool for Statics as well as performance on course examinations. Comparisons will be made between a treatment group, which was subject to the analysis assignments, and a control group, which did not complete the analysis assignments.

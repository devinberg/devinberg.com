## Abstract

Power wheelchair navigation may be more difficult for those who have a fine motor or cognitive disability. Some people are not able to use a powered wheelchair on their own and must depend on a caregiver. The design proposed here uses a prototyping platform to demonstrate a computer vision algorithm for identifying sidewalks and determining if the user is on path. The set-up uses color conversion and morphological methods to manipulate live video. The cost for the system is under $100 and uses entirely open-source technology.

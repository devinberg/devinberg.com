## Abstract
Active-learning is an eternal topic of study within the engineering mechanics education literature. Evidence suggests that active-learning can lead to better, or at least similar, student outcomes while providing for a more diverse learning environment, allowing students to demonstrate their learning in different ways. In this study, we investigated the use of motion capture technology in a dynamics course through a class project. Two different modalities were used, a marker-based motion capture system and a post-processing video analysis software. The influence on the student experience by the use of these two modalities was measured through a student experience survey. Similarly, a comparison was made between the two treatment groups based on their scores on quizzes, the project, and their course grades. The results indicate that the choice of data capture and analysis modality had limited impact on the student experience, their grades, or the project outcomes. In both cases, the students’ perception of the project was positive, and the majority indicated that they found value in the experience and felt that it should be continued in future semesters. There is a tradeoff between the instructor retaining control over the experimental design, which produces more reliable results, and granting greater control to the students, which allows for flexibility in project logistics.

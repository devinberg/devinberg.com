## Abstract
This paper presents three innovative, low-cost demonstrations aimed at enhancing student engagement and understanding in introductory mechanics of materials courses. The first two demonstrations focus on the concept of the angle of twist, particularly relevant in components such as gears and shafts. Through hands-on experimentation with geared shafts, students are able to visualize and grasp the fundamental principles behind this key concept, fostering a deeper appreciation of its significance in mechanical engineering applications. The third demonstration introduces a novel method to illustrate Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) without the need for specialized equipment. By using a high-precision force gauge and copper wires of varying thicknesses, students measure and predict the breaking force required for each wire, achieving an accuracy of approximately 10%. Both demonstrations not only deepen students' understanding of material behavior under loading conditions but also promote active learning and critical thinking in the field of mechanics of materials.

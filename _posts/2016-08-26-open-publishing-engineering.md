## Abstract

Openness is a cultural trait. It has been argued that open societies promote better quality of life.  Science and engineering have a long tradition of offering solutions  based on natural and built processes to improve quality of life and  bring prosperity. There are around 30,000 science and engineering  journals available today, with a majority based on a business model that  has proven successful. With some variation, this model comprises four  steps: authors submit their papers, peers review these anonymously, then, if accepted, rights are transferred to the publisher, and readers  pay in order to consume the final product. Some claim this  subscription-based journal model is needed to assure the quality of what  goes into the specialized press.

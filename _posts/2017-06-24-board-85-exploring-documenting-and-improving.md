## Abstract
Exploring, Documenting, and Improving Humanitarian Service Learning through Engineers without Borders-USA is a four-year project exploring a variety of challenges and opportunities in university-based service learning programs. Specifically, this project looks holistically at the inception and evolution of a new Engineers Without Borders USA chapter, while analyzing characteristics, values, and demographics of individuals involved in EWB community-based humanitarian projects in multiple chapters. Further, it examines the social, cultural, and professional interactions and exchanges between and among EWB members and community stakeholders in EWB projects, examining several projects from a variety of chapters across the country.

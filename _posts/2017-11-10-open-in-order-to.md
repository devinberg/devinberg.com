## Abstract

Engineering is a field that touches nearly every aspect of our lives. Almost anything human-made that you come into contact with on a day-to-day basis was worked on by an engineer during at least one phase of its development before coming to fruition. Whether it was in the initial design, the selection of materials, or the manufacturing method, engineering is deeply woven into the fabric of our lives as well as our economic, technological, and social development as a society. Despite the importance of engineering to society, there remains a large portion of our global population that are not able to participate as equal partners in the engineering practice. This includes participating both as consumers and contributors of engineering knowledge.

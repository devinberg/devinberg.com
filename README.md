This repository contains the source for my personal site at <http://www.devinberg.com>.

IMPORTANT!
===========
I am very happy for others to use my design as a basis for their own site but PLEASE ensure you delete all my _content_ (i.e., pages, blog posts, etc) before uploading your version to the web.

Be especially careful with some of the dynamic content and javascript I use on my pages, particularly:

* Cactus.chat comments on blog posts - These are hard coded to my cactus.chat account. If you just copy and paste my templates I will be the moderator of your blog's comments. You don't want that. If you don't know how to set up your own cactus.chat account please remove the code from the bottom of the `_layouts/post.html` file.


Basically, the rules are these:

* _If you don't understand it or didn't write it then remove it_.
* _Test your site on a local machine before you upload your site_.

Thanks.
